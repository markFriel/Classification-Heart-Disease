The following represent the Attributes that will be used to predict the presence of absence of a patient having heart disease.

1.  age -age in years
2.  sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)
3.  cp - chest pain type 
	a. Value 1: typical angina 
	b. Value 2: atypical angina 
	c. Value 3: non-anginal pain 
	d. Value 4: asymptomatic
4.  trestbps - resting blood pressure
5.  chol -  serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6.  fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
7.  restecg - resting electrocardiographic results 
	a. Value 0: normal 
	b. Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality  
	c. Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
8.  thalach  - maximum heart rate achieved
9.  exang  - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope ¬the slope of the peak exercise ST segment 
	a. Value 1: upsloping 
	b. Value 2: flat 
	c. Value 3: down sloping
12. Ca - number of major vessels (0-3) coloured by fluoroscopy
13. thal - thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect
14. Heart Disease Presence -  the predicted attribute
